# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
An analysis of PyBer rideshare data across January to early May of 2019 was conducted in order to visualize the differences in activity between "Rural", "Suburban" and "Urban" zones.
## Results
Upon creation of the data vizualization as shown below... 
 - It became evident that while the differences between suburban and urban PyBer activiy were more subtle, the lowest activity clearly happens in rural areas.
 - The urban area is the only area that had less rides than drivers
 - Fares seem to drop as the areas become more urban
 - While urban areas have the highest average fare total per week, this is also where weekly fares are most erratic.
 - Towards the end of March, the suburban area was the only area to decrease in weekly fare production.
 - Late February shows the most collective rise in activity across all city types.

## Summary
For the above reasons, I suggest the following business maneuvers for PyBer moving forward...
  - The fact that there are still more rides than there are current drivers in suburban areas leads me to believe that this might be the best area for PyBer recruitment. While the suburbs still produce respectable amounts of fares, it is clear that relative to the urban market, there is more opportunity for an increased ecosystem of workers in suburban areas.
  - With a consistent spike in activity across all city types at the end of February, I would reallocate marketing funds away from the middling suburban area and into the cash-producing urban sector, and maximized rural sector during this time next year. Since it seems like all three zones will rise, the most benefit should come from raising PyBer's floor and ceiling of income.
  - In contrast to the above advice, perhaps late March would be a time to reallocate marketing funds back to suburban areas. The line graph shows that while the other two city types have success at this time, the suburban market could use stimulation.
